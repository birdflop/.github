#### Birdflop is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit providing high-performance Minecraft servers and quality public resources as a catalyst for technological curiosity.

At the heart of our mission, we are dedicated to igniting and nurturing a passion for technology and computer science. We uniquely approach our mission by offering affordable and accessible hosting resources, not just as a service, but as a catalyst for technological curiosity. Our belief is rooted in the idea that the hands-on experience of creating and managing a game server can be a gateway to a lifelong interest in technology and computer science. By ensuring this journey is engaging and frustration-free, we significantly enhance the likelihood of sparking a deeper interest in technological fields.

Birdflop goes beyond mere hosting; we actively foster a community of learning and growth, exemplified through the wealth of public resources available on our Resources page. Looking ahead, we are committed to expanding our reach, investing in initiatives that fuel a passion for computer science and technology, and making a lasting impact in shaping future innovators.
